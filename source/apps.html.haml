        %h1 Flatpak Applications
        %p
          Flatpak applications are distributed in repositories. Anyone can set up a repository for their applications, and
          the users only need to add the repository to the local configuration to get full integration in both the
          command line and the graphical installation tools (such as gnome-software).
        %p
          However, most flatpak applications are available in a repository known as Flathub. See the
          =link_to "flathub site", "https://flathub.org/index.html#using"
          for details about how to use it.
          There is also a list of
          =link_to "all applications on flathub", "https://flathub.org/apps.html"
          that you can browse.
        %p
          This page lists some of the other repositories that are available, along with instructions for how
          to try them. If you don't have it already, you'll need to

              These command line instructions require Flatpak 0.6.13 or newer.
              Once installed, applications can be launched from the usual place in your desktop. For more
              information on how to update and manage your applications, see the

            %h2 GNOME unstable snapshots
            %p
              The stable builds of GNOME applications are available on flathub, but unstable development builds are available in a separate repository.
              Note that these are builds directly from the latest git version and have no guarantees that they work on any given date.

            %p First, make sure you have the unstable GNOME runtimes repository:
            %pre
              <span class='unselectable'>$ </span>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists gnome-nightly https://sdk.gnome.org/gnome-nightly.flatpakrepo
            %p Now add the GNOME applications repository:
            %pre
              <span class='unselectable'>$ </span>flatpak remote-add gnome-apps-nightly https://sdk.gnome.org/gnome-apps-nightly.flatpakrepo
            %p You can now list the available unstable gnome applications with:
            %pre
              <span class='unselectable'>$ </span>flatpak remote-ls gnome-apps-nightly
            %p And install them for example like:
            %pre
              <span class='unselectable'>$ </span>flatpak install gnome-apps-nightly org.gnome.Maps
