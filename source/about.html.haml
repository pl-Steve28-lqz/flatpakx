          Flatpak is developed by an independent community, made up of contributors, volunteers and supporting organizations. It is a true upstream open source project, dedicated to providing technology and services that can be used by all, with no vendor lock-in. We have strong links to other Free Software projects, including the Freedesktop project.
        %p
          All our code is freely available, with no contributor agreement required. Volunteers and contributing organizations are welcome, as equal partners.
